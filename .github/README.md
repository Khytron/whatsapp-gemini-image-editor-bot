This program leverages the use of the Gemini API specifically the gemini-3-pro-image-preview model for generating high quality images edit in just a few seconds..
It also uses Render to set up a VM to host the program on 24/7 specifically using Uptime Robot to overcome Render's weakness that it needed a URL every few mins to stay active

Requirements: 
- node.js
- npm

  To run this program, navigate to the directory of the project folder, then run "node index.js"
